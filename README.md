Shelf Lib
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/not-nexus/shelf-lib-go.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/not-nexus/shelf-lib-go)

Library for interfacing with [shelf](https://github.com/not-nexus/shelf).
There is an associated CLI for this library here [not-nexus/shelfcli](https://github.com/not-nexus/shelfcli).

Why did we pick GO?
-------------------

We wanted a CLI that could be used to easily interfact with Shelf
that could be statically compiled and dropped on a machine without
worrying about conflicts or external dependencies.
