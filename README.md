Shelf Lib
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/quantumew/shelflib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/quantumew/shelflib)

Library for interfacing with [kyle-long/pyshelf](https://github.com/kyle-long/pyshelf).
There is an associated CLI for this library here [kyle-long/shelfcli](https://github.com/kyle-long/shelfcli).

Why did we pick GO?
-------------------

We wanted a CLI that could be used to easily interfact with Shelf
that could be statically compiled and dropped on a machine without
worrying about conflicts or external dependencies.
